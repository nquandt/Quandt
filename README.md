# Quandt
A collection of API and helpers for .NET 6 + 2.0 Standard. 

Quandt.Expressions.Javascript is a metaprogramming library I'm starting to convert JS to C# using LINQ Expressions.. Not IL or an interpreter. I believe it would classified as a Transpiler and so I named things accordingly. At some point I might put it on Nuget if I get a decent working prototype going.

Feel free to check it out and contibute. [Quandt.Expressions.Javascript](https://github.com/nquandt/Quandt/tree/master/src/Expressions/Expressions.Javascript/src)
