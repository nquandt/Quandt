This package is an opinionated implementation of Minimal APIs. It utilizes an Endpoint pattern. Much inspiration was taken from Steve Smith's [ApiEndpoints project](https://github.com/ardalis/ApiEndpoints), and [this blog post](https://tyrrrz.me/blog/fluent-generics).

Feel free to use/fork/or submit Issues and PR's. This is MIT but I would ask that if you have a substantial feature you believe is needed or helpful submit to this repo. 

Thanks for checking out my project.
